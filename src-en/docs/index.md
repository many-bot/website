### How to contribute

It depends on how you like to contribute. Below we'll cover two methods: **pull requests** and **git patches**.

#### Pull requests

The most common way these days.

1. Go to our repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/many-bot) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/many-bot).
2. Fork the repository.
3. Clone your fork:
```
git clone https://...
```
4. Create a branch:
```
git checkout -b my-fix
```
5. Make your changes.
6. Commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Fix issue X"
```
7. Push to your fork:
```
git push origin my-fix
```
8. Open your fork's page on GitHub/Codeberg.
9. Click "Create Pull Request".
10. Choose:
- Base: `manybot/main`
- Compare: `your-fork/my-fix`
11. Write a description and submit.

#### Git patches

Patches are the classic way, still widely used in projects like the *Linux Kernel Organization*.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://...
```
2. Create a branch:
```
git checkout -b my-fix
```
3. Make your changes and commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Fix issue X"
```
4. Generate the patch:
```
git format-patch main --stdout > my-fix.patch
```
5. Send the patch by email to [devel@stxerr.dev](mailto:devel@stxerr.dev).

You can do this directly from the terminal with `git send-email`:
```
git send-email --to=devel@stxerr.dev my-fix.patch
```

> To set up `git send-email`, check your email provider's documentation or use a local SMTP server like `msmtp`.

Received patches will be reviewed and applied with `git am`:
```
git am my-fix.patch
```
